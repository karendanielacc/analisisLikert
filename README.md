Plot Likert
===========
This is a library to visualize results from Likert-style survey questions in Python, using matplotlib.

It's inspired by Jason Bryer's great [`likert` package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/likert/), but nowhere near as good.

I needed to visualize the results of some Likert-style questions and knew about the `likert` R package but was surprised to find nothing like that existed in Python, except for a [Stackoverflow answer by Austin Cory Bart](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41384812). This library builds on that solution and packages it as a library.

(I've since discovered that there may be other solutions out there, for example https://github.com/dmardanbeigi/Likert_Scale_Plot_in_Python)

At this stage, it can best be considered a quick-and-dirty hack and lacks a lot of features that would be nice to have.
