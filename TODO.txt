At this stage, this project can best be considered a quick-and-dirty hack and lacks a lot of features that would be nice to have, including:

- Support for 7-point (or other) scales
- Less hacky legend
- Better padding for the plot
- Support for Python 2
- Alternate color schemes

Your contribution for these (or any other) features is very welcome!
